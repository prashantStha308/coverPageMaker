# Personalized Front Page Maker

A simple web tool for creating front pages for your report assignments.

## What it does

This app helps students at CCT, Dharan to quickly create front pages. Just fill in your details and get a ready-to-use front page with the college logo and proper formatting. This is currently only available for IT faculties, including both BIT and CSIT

## How does it work?

This app makes use of the `html2canvas` javaScript library to screenshot a HTML node and makes it available to download.

## Running it locally

Make sure you have node installed into your system

```bash
    # Clone this repository
    git clone https://github.com/prashantStha308/coverPageMaker.git

    # Change Directory
